# The name is [Zuri](http://www.zurihunter.com)! 

## Here are some lovely tales about me!
😀 **she/her**

I am a **Data Engineer** 👩🏾‍💻 at this really cool place called the 🏟️🏟️🏉🏉🏈🏈**[National Football League](http://www.nfl.com)**🏈🏈🏉🏉🏟️🏟️! 

I am an alumna from the illustrious ⚪️🔵🔴**Howard University**🔴🔵⚪.️

I am currently making magic happen with **_Javascript_** and 🐍  but I like to dabble in ♦️ and ☕️.

I like to talk about my _side projects_, _techie hobbies_ and my experience as a _black women in tech_. You can check them out:

I like to contribute to the world knowledge by writing tutorials on various topics in tech and community organizing. Here are some below:
* [Beginner Friendly Introduction to GitLAB CI/CD](https://dev.to/zurihunter/beginner-friendly-introduction-to-gitlabcicd-4p5a)
* [How I Built my first Twitch Bot with Natural Language Processing](https://dev.to/zurihunter/how-i-built-my-first-twitch-bot-with-nlu-fid)

I come from a _non-traditional_ coding background as well and I had an interesting journey breaking into the industry, you can learn more about my journey from reading **"Code with Veni"** Blog, [Meet Zuri: Queen of Hackathons](http://blog.codewithveni.com/meet-zuri-queen-hackathons/)

I like to make an impact on the planet 🌍 by volunteering as a **Technical Lead** for [Black Girls Code](http://www.blackgirlscode.org) and **Hackathon Organizer** for Howard University School of Business Hackathon [Bison Hacks](http://www.bisonhacks.com). Formerly I was a **Ruby on Rails Lead** for [Women Who Code DC](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC) and **Leadership Lead** for [DCFemTech](http://www.dcfemtech.org). I like to volunteer to organizations that are dedicated to improving the status quo of minorities and women in the tech industry.

I don't always code 24/7, I have hobbies like gaming on my PlayStation, 3D Modeling, Embroidery, Felting, Drawing and Billiards.
